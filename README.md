# TMP_Freight_Project
Analyzing US–Canada & US–Mexico Freight Trends using CRISP-DM Framework


## 1. Project Overview  
– Purpose, stakeholders, and context.
The objective of this project is to analyze the transportation data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights related to the efficiency and impacts of freight transportation across various modes (road, rail, air, and water). Using this data, the goal is to identify inefficiencies, recognize patterns, and propose actionable solutions to improve the overall performance and sustainability of transportation systems.


## 2. Business Questions  
1.	What are the overall trends in freight volume and value or revenue over time? 
2.	Which transport mode (truck, rail, pipeline, air, vessel) dominated in terms of weight and value? 
3.	How did trade values evolve per country (U.S.–Canada vs. U.S.–Mexico)? 
4.	Which ports of entry consistently handled the highest number of shipments? 
5.	What were the top commodity types traded with each country? 
6.	What was the total number of shipments and value made across the years? 
7.	Which freight modes had higher freight charges on average? 


## 3. Data Understanding

– Initial findings (missing values, distribution)

## 4. Data Preparation  
– Cleaning steps & rationale  
– Feature engineering details

## 5. Analysis & Visualization  
- Business questions are answered through various vizualisations e.g.bar charts, line graphs, etc. 

## 6. Conclusions & Recommendations  
– Summary insights  
– Actionable steps

## 7. Limitations & Future Work  
– Data gaps, seasonality, potential expansions

## 8. Files
– Notebooks, scripts, presentation
